# P.E.R.S.O.N.A.
## Portraying Empathic Robotic Simulations Of Natural Affections
This repository contains the core of P.E.R.S.O.N.A., an AI created for artistic expression of human empathy during the [CreARTathon](https://creartathon.com/) competition.
Several modules, listed below, have been integrated together to obtain the final art piece:
- The computer vision module is based [WebGazer](https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer).
- The implementation of the Multi-Armed Bandit problem using SoftMax algorithm to train P.E.R.S.O.N.A. has been inspired by [Kenneth Foo](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/multi-armed-bandit-analysis-of-softmax-algorithm-e1fa4cb0c422).
- The 3D model and facial expression of P.E.R.S.O.N.A. have been created using [MetaHuman](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/metahuman-creator?sessionInvalidated=true) and [UnrealEngine](https://www.unrealengine.com/).
- The ultrasonic proximity sensor is powered by [Arduino](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_ultrasonic_sensor.htm)
